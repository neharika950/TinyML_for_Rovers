### Table IV. Deployment Performance Comparison for DNN Model

| Model Type            | Latency | RAM    | Flash   | Accuracy |
| --------------------- | ------- | ------ | ------- | -------- |
| Quantized (INT8)      | 1 ms    | 1.2 KB | 11.1 KB | 89.88%   |
| Unoptimized (Float32) | 1 ms    | 1.2 KB | 11.1 KB | 93.57%   |

**Observation:**
Quantization reduces numerical precision while maintaining identical latency and memory footprint, with a small accuracy drop (~3.7%).

## Table V. Deployment Metrics for 1D CNN Model

| Model Type            | Latency | RAM    | Flash   | Accuracy |
| --------------------- | ------- | ------ | ------- | -------- |
| Quantized (INT8)      | 1 ms    | 1.2 KB | 11.1 KB | 76.13%   |
| Unoptimized (Float32) | 10 ms   | 1.2 KB | 11.1 KB | 82.18%   |

**Observation:**

* Quantization significantly reduces latency (10 ms → 1 ms).
* Slight accuracy drop (~6%).
* Memory footprint remains consistent across versions.
